                        <p>This paper presents an original one-dimensional statistical model designed to complement experimental data from a practical dielectric barrier discharge (DBD) reactor. The experimental setup consists of a plasma-assisted reactor with gas injection composed solely of CH4 and O2. The numerical procedure uses electrical measurements to provide a realistic description of the power consumption and the current flowing through the gas, in a complex scenario where approximately one hundred current peaks are measured per electrical half-period. A plasma kinetic model is then used to analyze the chemistry and characteristic times of both isolated discharges and a representative train of discharges occurring within the reactor. These times are used to optimize the computational costs and to select the most appropriate kinetic schemes for the gas phase, whether in a plasma or quasi-thermodynamic equilibrium state. This approach also allows the separation of fast transformations (plasma) occurring at constant volume, from slower transformations occurring at constant pressure. The statistical approach, based on a Monte Carlo method, clearly identifies the assumptions required to reduce the real complexity of the DBD reactor to a 1D flow model. The combination of chromatographic measurements at the reactor outlet and numerical simulations provides the heterogeneity factor of the discharges, which is identified as a key parameter in the model. Although the flow can be considered stationary on average, the obtained value reveals a highly heterogeneous spatial distribution of the discharges within the reactor. Thus, the numerical results suggest that the gases passing through the reactor are rarely in a plasma state.</p>

                        <p>This study investigates the response of a laminar methane-air flame to Nanosecond Repetitively Pulsed (NRP) discharges in a canonical wall-stabilized burner using a combined experimental and numerical approach. The flow and flame behaviors were modeled using Direct Numerical Simulation (DNS) with an Analytically Reduced Chemistry for a precise chemical description. A phenomenological model incorporating detailed plasma kinetics and experimental observations was developed to simulate plasma effects. Zero-dimensional plasma reactor simulations were used to build up a reduced-order model describing discharge energy distribution in the specific conditions studied. Experimental measurements of electrical profiles identified two discharge regimes: a low-energy Corona discharge and a higher-energy Glow discharge, characterized by distinct spatial energy distributions. Experimental flame response analysis revealed three major phases: marginal response up to 100 pulses, a downstream shift of the flame tip, and stabilization after 400 pulses. Numerical simulations indicated that the Corona regime is crucial for explaining initial flame responses, while the Glow regime influences later stages. Adjustments in the Vibrationalâ€“Translational (VT) energy relaxation time and energy deposition ratios between fresh and burnt gases were necessary to match experimental observations. Additionally, an accurate modeling of the transient and steady-state flame responses requires integrating both the specificity of the Corona and the Glow discharge regimes. Future work should focus on measuring or theoretically calculating N2(v) relaxation times in CH4-H2O-CO2 mixtures and analyzing the spatial energy distribution of discharges interacting with flames to enhance plasma-combustion coupled models.</p>

                        <p>Plasma Assisted Combustion (PAC) is a promising technology to enhance the combustion of lean mixtures prone to instabilities and flame blow-off. Although many PAC experiments demonstrated combustion enhancement, several studies report an increase in NOx emissions. The aim of this study is to determine the kinetic pathways leading to NOx formation in the second stage of a sequential combustor assisted by Nanosecond Repetitively Pulsed Discharges (NRPDs). For this purpose, Large Eddy Simulation (LES) associated with an accurate description of the combustion/NOx chemistry and a phenomenological model of the plasma kinetics is used. Detailed kinetics 0-Dimensional reactors complement the study. First, the LES setup is validated by comparison with experiments. Then, the NOx chemistry is analyzed. For the conditions of operation studied, it is shown that the production of atomic nitrogen in the plasma by direct electron impact on nitrogen molecules increases the formation of NO. Then, the NO molecules are transported through the turbulent flame without being strongly affected. This study illustrates the need to limit the diatomic nitrogen dissociation process in order to mitigate harmful emissions. More generally, the very good agreement with experimental measurements demonstrates the capability of LES combined with accurate models to predict the NRPD effects on both turbulent combustion and NOx emissions.</p>

                        <p>In this work, the use of Nanosecond Repetitively Pulsed (NRP) discharges is investigated numerically to improve the stabilisation of the flame in a swirl burner. The studied configuration is the PACCI burner test rig set up at KAUST, in which it was experimentally demonstrated that NRP discharges can effectively enhance flame stability. Simulations are performed with the reactive compressible Navierâ€“Stokes solver AVBP, using a recently developed phenomenological model for plasma-assisted combustion of methane-air premixed flame. The ability of the numerical model to reproduce the main flow behaviours is first assessed by comparison with PIV measurements in cold flow conditions. Then, a lean atmospheric pressure case (phi=0.67) without plasma actuation is simulated and compared with OH* chemiluminescence image from experiment. Both numerical and experimental results reveal an unstable turbulent flame, with intermittent attachment to the burner exit. Finally, two operating conditions with NRP discharges are simulated. The NRP discharges correspond to 10 kV pulses applied at a frequency of 20 and 30 kHz, respectively corresponding to a discharge power 0.72 and 1.17% of the thermal flame power. First, a significant stabilisation effect is observed when applying the discharges, which efficiently mitigate the flame lifting. This effect is quantitatively demonstrated by tracking the flame centre of gravity, which shows that the flame moves upstream under the influence of the plasma, in good agreement with experimental observations. Results also show that a net power gain is obtained by applying NRP discharges to combustion by comparing the thermal flame power to the plasma power. In particular, an increase of plasma actuation efficiency from 4 to 6 as been observed in the cases studied by increasing the plasma power.</p>

                        <p>The recent advances in plasma-assisted combustion must now
                        be strengthened through high-fidelity numerical simulations.
                        However, detailed plasma-combustion coupled simulations in
                        complex geometry and turbulent flow involving hundreds of
                        discharges are still unaffordable due to prohibitive
                        computational costs. In this work, a Plasma-Assisted
                        Combustion phenoMenological modelIng for Non-equilibrium
                        Discharges (PACMIND) is proposed. The model aims to avoid
                        computing in detail the plasma phase and consists of
                        incorporating the leading order plasma effects on the
                        reactive compressible Navierâ€“Stokes equations. It consists
                        of two ultra-fast effects with radical productions and gas
                        heating, as well as a slower gas heating due to vibrational
                        energy relaxation. Based on detailed kinetic simulations,
                        the model has been applied to air and methane-air mixtures
                        and contains respectively 5 species, 3 reactions and 12
                        species, 7 reactions. The model has been validated against
                        experiments in air and detailed plasma-assisted combustion
                        ignition simulations in methane-air at various equivalence
                        ratios and reduced electric fields. Significant improvements
                        regarding ignition delay times have been observed by
                        comparison with an existing model. In addition, the model
                        accounts for NOx production by plasma discharge and covers
                        the full range of conditions encountered in a premixed
                        flame. Hence, it opens the way to the simulation of
                        realistic 3D turbulent configurations with minimal
                        over-costs.</p>

                        <p>The ignition of an atmospheric pressure laminar premixed methane/air mixture by Nanosecond Repetitively Pulsed (NRP) discharges in a pin-pin configuration is studied using fully coupled plasma-combustion numerical simulations. These simulations are performed using the AVIP code specifically developed for low temperature plasma modeling and coupled to the combustion code AVBP. A reduced chemical scheme for plasma-assisted combustion previously derived and validated is used to investigate the effect of the frequency of NRP discharges and the benefits of their chemical enhancement. It is observed that the induced shock wave produced by strong discharges is of major importance for ignition and can lead to quenching of the ignition kernels through strong induced recirculation of gases. Increasing the frequency of the discharges reduces this effect by depositing less energy at each discharge and accumulating energy more homogeneously between the electrodes, leading to a faster and more stable ignition. The minimum energy necessary to ignite decreases with increasing frequency and at the highest studied frequency (100 kHz) ignition has been achieved with 30% less energy than with a single-pulse discharge.</p>

                        <p>For several years now plasma assisted combustion has been the subject of intense research due to stabilization effects a plasma can have on flames. Particularly, experiments have shown the promising impact of Nanosecond Repetitively Pulsed discharges on combustion while not exceeding an energy consumption of a few percent of the flame power. In this work, an incremental methodology with a step-by-step approach has been used to build a single plasma mechanism upon which combustion is added using the GRI 3.0 and Konnov v0.6. The methodology focuses on three key aspects of plasma assisted combustion: fast gas heating, slow gas heating and radical production. Selected experiments focusing on one or more of these aspects allow to validate the mechanism in large ranges of temperature (300-1500 K) and pressure (0.1-1 bar) in air, methane-air and argon diluted mixtures using glow and spark discharges. These experiments include a plasma assisted ignition case on which the ignition delay time is well captured by the mechanism. Slow gas heating has been modeled using a vibrational relaxation model validated against a detailed vibrational description. Discussions on ambiguous rates for critical reactions of excited nitrogen quenching are made in the light of their impact on the results on the chosen experiments. Finally, the resulting 100-species GRI 3.0-based and 264-species Konnov v0.6-based plasma mechanisms are reduced to make them suitable for multi-dimensional simulations. The DRGEP reduction method, based on plasma experiments and canonical combustion cases, is applied allowing to reduce the number of species by a factor larger than two. For the GRI-3.0 plasma mechanism, the reduced mechanism contains 47 species and 429 reactions. Hence significant performance is gained, opening the way to multi-dimensional simulations of plasma assisted combustion.</p>

                        <p>A new unstructured, massively parallel code dedicated to low temperature plasmas, AVIP, is presented to simulate plasma discharges in interaction with combustion. The plasma species are modeled in a drift-diffusion formulation and the Poisson equation is solved consistently with the charged species. Plasma discharges introduce stiff source terms on the reactive Navier-Stokes equations and Riemann solvers, more robust than the schemes available in AVBP, have been implemented in AVIP and reported back in AVBP to solve the reactive Navier-Stokes equations. The validation of all the numerical schemes is carried out in this paper where numerous validation cases are presented for the plasma drift-diffusions equations and the reactive Navier-Stokes equations.</p>
